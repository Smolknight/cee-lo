# Matthew Mendoza's game of cee-lo
## if you want to understand best, have the code pulled up
## this guide was made to be read at the same time as the code

# Objects



## players
This object is used to store the data between the player and the robot (not really, it just random numbers)

only infomation stored is points and who turn it is

---

## dice
this object was made to contain the digital dice we roll

d stands for dice and the number next to it tells you which dice it so d2 refers to dice 2

---

## game

Game object is used to store data about the game overall

## time

this subobject stores the remaining time. This game would go on forever without a timer and there got to be tension in here somehow

## pot
this stores how much money there is in the pot

## setpoint
this stores set point and triple value
got lazy and this saves the amount of variables needed

---

## function roll

this function is what roles the dice and starts of the chain reaction of events

## segment 1
